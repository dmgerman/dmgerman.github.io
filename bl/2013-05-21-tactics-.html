        <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Wilson_(writer)">Jonathan Wilson</a> is one of the best analysts of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football">Beautiful Game</a>. He
answers an important question: <em>what is the relationship between
players and tactics?</em> and then I ask <em>does this have any relevance to
software engineering?</em></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>His <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2013/apr/10/th-question-players-tactics-jonathan-wilson">article</a> breaks tactics into two layers: <em>base</em> and
<em>superstructure</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Base governs which side creates more chances and what sort of chances
they are; superstructure determines whether those chances are taken.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, it is more complex than that. I wonder if there is an extra
layer: the skill of each player. Perhaps this is part of the
<em>base</em>. Skill is divided into the innate, and the part that can be
taught&#x2013;usually in the long term. It is not the same to have Messi,
Falcao or Ronaldo in your team compared to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Wondolowski">Chris Wondolowski</a>. Rich
teams can improve this part of their <em>base</em> with signings, hence the
reason we are seeing the establishment of the era of the Super Teams
in EUFA.</p>

<p>There is another part of the <em>base</em> that is essentially the work
that a coach does for a team. This includes the organization of the
team on the field, the design of set pieces, the preparation before
each game, the designation of the starting 11, substitutions, etc.</p>

<p>And this helps explain why I admire some coaches, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Pellegrini">Pellegrini</a>,
who with a weaker <em>base</em> of players, can create a team that can
compete with the best in Europe. I think he will be spectacular in his
new job at Manchester City.</p>

<p>Then it comes superstructure, which is the non-deterministic part of
the game, and why we are not playing with robots.</p>

<p>In Wilson&rsquo;s words, the objective of the tactics is to reduce the
chances to score of the other team, and to improve your own.  His
analysis makes me think of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210166/">Moneyball</a>.  One of Billy Beane&rsquo;s goals was to get
players that improved the chance to score runs for a team.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Software development is a team sport.'>
Which brings me to software engineering: <strong>Software development is a team sport.</strong>
Any software development team has players with their own /base/. Some
are better than others. We can always go out and try to hire /better
ones/ (based on pure skill). We know that some programmers can be as
productive as 10 times others.
html:</span></p>

<p>There is a part of their <em>base</em> that can be taught. I always wonder
why managers are not more proactive at teaching their players how to
improve their debugging or editing. It is as if these skills are
expected to be learned on their own. As if we are knowledge workers,
not production line ones, even though frequently we would benefit from
learning how to improve our processes as if we were in a production line.</p>

<p>Now, imagine you were just promoted to be the coach (the <em>manager</em>) of
the team. You might have a chance to make few signings or you might
have to be content with the team you have (unless you work for a Super
Team &#x2014;e.g. Google&#x2014; where you might have a lot of money to hire the
best) . Say you get a budget, what type of player would you hire?</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='If tactics play a role in software development, then
we need to choose a player that fits the team, and makes the team
better; not necessarily the best player available in the market.'>
Think about it. If tactics play a role in software development, then
we need to choose a player that fits the team, and makes the team
better; not necessarily the best player available in the market. And
who works better for the team might not be the best developer out
there. For example, a team might be better of with a great tester than
with a productive software developer that hates testing. Are these
decisions considered by a typical manager? I don&rsquo;t know.
html:</span></p>

<p>Now, if we take a Moneyball point of view, we should start to align
features of players with their ability to create chances to score. In
software development teams this means the chance not to screw
up. Software development teams are combination of individuals each
with unique strengths; if the manager is able to create a good <em>base</em>
around them, they will be able to produce more than working
individually (even if working towards the same common goal).</p>

<p>I have had a SE manager that was a good tactician (I had around 10 in
my life as a developer). I wonder if they exist. Usually they care
about tracking deadlines, and break the work apart so each of us could
do our part, but I never had a feeling that we were working together
supporting each other as we completed our work.</p>

<p>I am sure there are certainly software developers that make their
teams better around them. I think we need to learn to quantify
this. And we need to learn how to make software development managers
better at improving their <em>base</em>.</p>
