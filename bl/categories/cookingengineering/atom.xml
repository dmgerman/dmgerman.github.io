    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Achatz">Grant Achatz</a> is one of the great chefs of our times. His restaurant
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alinea_(restaurant)">Alinea</a> (in Chicago) is considered one of the best in the world.</p>

<p>In a presentation he gave at Harvard (almost 3 years ago) he talked about
his approach to cooking and some of the innovative techniques he has
developed. But what I remember the most are two questions he was posed
by the audience, and his answers:</p>

<blockquote><p>Audience member: &ldquo;Roasted hey, wood stocks, apparently turn into very tasty things. There has to be some really abysmal failures you&rsquo;d never wish on the tongues of even your worst enemies&#x2026;Any you would like to share?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grant: &ldquo;There are tonnes of failures. But we know that going in. <strong>We are not afraid  to fail</strong>.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>I suspect that that attitude: willing to try and not being afraid to fail is what makes them succeed.</p>

<p>Another interesting question is:</p>

<blockquote><p>Audience member: &ldquo;If I had to add three things to my kitchen that my parents didn&rsquo;t have, what would they be?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Grant answers:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthan_gum">Xanthan Gum</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrageenan">IOTA Carrogeenan</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar_agar">Agar Agar</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>I have never used IOTA, but I use agar-agar and xanthan gum on a regular basis.</p>

<p>The presentation is well worth it, and also the Q&amp;A section at the end.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I knew I was never going to be able to get a reservation at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Bulli">elBulli</a> (note the camelCase
:).  But since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferran_Adri%C3%A0">Ferran
Adri√†</a> decided to close it
I knew I had a chance to one day eat at the best restaurant in the
world.</p>

<p>Looking at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World's_50_Best_Restaurants">rakings of the best places to
eat</a> <!-- more -->
I decided that that restaurant was going to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Celler_de_Can_Roca">El Cellar de CanRoca</a>.</p>

<p>Two years before, I was visiting Girona, and decided to walk into the
restaurant (no planning from my part, as usual). Of course, there was
no space :). I asked my friend Jaume, who lives in Girona, to reserve
a table. He did, last year.  And just few days ago, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2013/apr/29/el-celler-de-can-roca-restaurant">the Cellar was
named the best restaurant in the
world</a>. I
am glad we went when we did. I was told that the day it was announced,
its web site crashed and they got thousands of phone calls.</p>

<p>Was it worth it? You bet. Here are the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/28858028@N00/sets/72157629963362602/">photos of each of the dishes
we were
served</a>. It
has been, without a doubt, the best meal in my life, and the longest
(we arrived at 1:30 and left at 5:30).</p>
