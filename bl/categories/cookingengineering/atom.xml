    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I knew I was never going to be able to get a reservation at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Bulli">elBulli</a> (note the camelCase
:).  But since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferran_Adri%C3%A0">Ferran
Adri√†</a> decided to close it
I knew I had a chance to one day eat the best restaurant in the
world.</p>

<p>Looking at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World's_50_Best_Restaurants">rakings of the best places to
eat</a> <!--more-->
I decided that that restaurant was going to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Celler_de_Can_Roca">El Cellar de CanRoca</a>.</p>

<p>Two years before, I was visiting Girona, and decided to walk into the
restaurant (no planning from my part, as usual). Of course, there was
no space :). I asked my friend Jaume, who lives in Girona, to reserve
a table. He did, last year.  And just few days ago, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2013/apr/29/el-celler-de-can-roca-restaurant">the Cellar was
named the best restaurant in the
world</a>. I
am glad we went when we did. I was told that the day it was announced,
its web site crashed and they got thousands of phone calls.</p>

<p>Was it worth it? You bet. Here are the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/28858028@N00/sets/72157629963362602/">photos of each of the dishes
we were
served</a>. It
has been, without a doubt, the best meal in my life, and the longest
(we arrived at 1:30 and left at 5:30).</p>
