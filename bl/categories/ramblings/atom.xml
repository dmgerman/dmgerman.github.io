    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The results of the NSERC Discovery Grants for 2013 have been published.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/NSERC-CRSNG/FundingDecisions-DecisionsFinancement/ResearchGrants-SubventionsDeRecherche/ResultsGSC-ResultatsCSS_eng.asp?Year=2013">full list of results can be found here</a>.
As it is becoming a tradition (results of <a href="../bl/2013-05-13-nserc-discovery-grants-2012.html">2011</a>, <a href="../bl/2011-06-21-nserc-discovery-grants-2011-in-computer-science.html">2012)</a>, here is my analysis of this year&rsquo;s results.</p>

<h1>What is the distribution of grants?</h1>

<p>The total amount for Discovery Grants in Computer Science was
$4,894,000 (
$5,943,920 last year) divided into 204 grants
(227 last year). There were 3 1-year and 187 5-year
(11 1-year, 3 3-year, 213 5-year in 2012). They went to 42 different institutions (49 last year).</p>

<p>Minimum amount was $15k ($14k last year), first quartile $20k ($17k),
median $20 ($22k), mean $25.758k ($25.38k), 3rd $30k ($28k), max $75k
($122.2k).</p>

<p>Compared to 2012, there is a slight reduction in the size awards.</p>

<p>This is the distribution of grants per amount.</p>

<p>A simple way to visualize this data is tot plot individuals to amounts. Colours reflect the province (click to enlarge):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2013/nserc2013byInd.png"></p>

<p>As it can be seen, there is a fairly uniform distribution across the lowest amounts, with few outliers to the right. Not surprisingly Ontario is, again, the most frequent.
Ontario and BC represent most of the points at the right side.</p>

<h2>By Province</h2>

<p>Here is a breakdown of the 4 big ones:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2013/ab2013.png" alt="Alberta" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2013/bc2013.png" alt="British Columbia" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2013/on2013.png" alt="Ontario" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2013/qc2013.png" alt="Quebec" /></p>

<h2>How do institutions compare?</h2>

<p>I present the results arranged by University. Each vertical column is
a university; they have been sorted by province.  Each point in the
plot is a recipient. The colour of the point represents the type of
grant (1 to 5 years). Most are 5 years, with few being 1 year (what I
call probation grant: they either have faith you can do significantly
better next year, or they are giving you a warning signal).</p>

<p>The median across the country was $20k per year (in the spirit of disclosure mine is $24k&#x2013;2011).</p>

<p>The boxplots are a simpler way to compare universities and are
overlayed on the data. I have removed outliers from them to avoid
confusion with the data points. Of course, if you have paid attention
to your stats courses you will know that boxplots are good when the
data is normally distributed (which I don&rsquo;t assume it is). Hence their
use in this data is flawed, but they are still useful.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2013/nserc2013byInst.png" alt="By institution" /></p>

<p>I also got curious who the high fliers were. And below the points are labelled.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2013/nserc2013byInstLabels.png" alt="By institution with labels." /></p>

<h2>Everybody</h2>

<p>And here is the list of every single person:</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>At this point, everybody is in the new cycle. This will make comparing across years easier. That will be the next installment&#x2026;</p>

    <updated>2013-05-24T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://turingmachine.org/bl/what-does-an-imdb-rating-of-a-movie-mean</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The last few years I have found less and less interesting movies to
watch. Maybe I am just getting old ;)</p>

<p>One simple, but effective way I have used in the past to determine if
a movie is worth watching is to use its <a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a> rating. Except for few comedies (e.g. Monty Python) I have always enjoyed any movie in the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/chart/top">IMDB TOP 250</a>.</p>

<p>But what is a good ranking? Let us try to answer that question&#x2026;</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I have data from the IMDB up to May 2013. One of the files that they
provide includes, for each movie, a weighted rank (from 0 to 10), and the
number of votes (plus some other info that we are not going to use).</p>

<p>There are 210,371 movies. But not all of them have the same
importance. The minimum number of votes is 5 and the maximum 971,041
&mdash;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161">The Shawshank Redemption (1994)</a>, one of the IMDBs all-time favorites.</p>

<p>Here is the distribution of the number of votes in that dataset. 75%
of movies have less than 118 votes!</p>

<pre><code>    Votes       
Min.   :     5  
1st Qu.:    11  
Median :    26  
Mean   :  1524  
3rd Qu.:   118  
Max.   :971041  
</code></pre>

<p>Let us choose only movies that have a significant number of votes. Let
us use 10k as the threshold. This leave us with 4,634 movies (I wonder
how many movies Pic A Flic has).  This is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot">Violin plot</a> of the rank of
movies in the IMD with at least 10,000 votes. It shows, in a single
plot, two ones: a density kernel (the outside) and boxplot (the
inside). The kernel tell us that this has an almost normal
distribution and its peak is around 6.7. In fact, the median is 6.7
(that means that 50 percent of movies with at least 10k votes are
above 6.7) and the average is 6.6. In fact, the 75% is 7.4 (the black
area in the middle of the plot ends at the first 25%, and 75%
quartiles&#x2013;i.e. 25% of the movies are below 6.0). So if you go to the
Rental store, and see a movie that is relatively popular and has a
rank of 7.5, then it is within the top 25% of movies. If you are very picky,
use a threshold of 8.0: there are only 430 with higher than 8, or approximately 9% of the
movies in the IMDB with at least 10k votes.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2013/imdbByVotes.png" alt="Violin plot of the distribution of Rank of Movies with at least 10k votes." /></p>

<p>This only holds true for Movies. For TV-shows the numbers are very
skewed towards 10, and there have significantly less votes.</p>

<p>So next time they ask you: <em>what movie should we rent?</em> Simply answer:
any with at least 10,000 votes in the IMDB and at least a rank
of 8. Or even better, one of the top 250.</p>

<p>One word of caution: latest movies tend to be overvalued and their
rankings lower as time passed by. For example, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2592910/">CM101MMXI Fundamentals
(2013)</a> has a current rating of 9.2 with 690,768 votes!!!! A movie I
never heard of, but maybe a total success in Turkey, has more votes
than <em>all</em> but 8 other movies, and a rank that is the highest except
for one movie. Suspicious, if you ask me. Also, the voting data the
IMDB provides does not seem to match exactly what is online.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The day of the publication of the results of the NSERC Discovery
Grants for 2013 is approaching, and I just realized that I didn&rsquo;t
publish the ones from 2012, which
<a href="../bl/2011-06-21-nserc-discovery-grants-2011-in-computer-science.html">I did for 2011</a>.</p>

<h1>What is the distribution of grants?</h1>

<p>First, the total amount for Discovery Grants in Computer Science was
$5,943,920 per year ($5,126,543 last year) divided into 227 grants
(202 last year). There were 11 1-year, 3 3-year, 213 5-year (10
1-year, 1 2-year, 1-3 year and the rest 5 years in 2011). They went to
49 different institutions (45 in 2011).</p>

<p>Minimum amount was (like the year before) $14k, first quantile $17k
(20k last year), median $22k (24 last year), average $26,185 ($25.380k
last year), third quartile $28k ($29k), and maximum of $122.2 ($96k
last year). A Shapiro-Wilk test shows that this distribution appears
NOT to be normal (p &lt;&lt; 0.01).</p>

<p>Compared to 2011, there was more money available per person (26.2k
versus 25.4k), and there were many more smaller grant, but also the
larger grants accounted for a larger share (one person got a lot of
money).</p>

<p>This is the distribution of grants per amount.</p>
