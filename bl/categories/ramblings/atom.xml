    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The day of the publication of the results of the NSERC Discovery Grants for 2013 is approaching, and I just realized that I didn&rsquo;t publish the ones from 2012, which
<a href="/bl/2011/06/21/nserc-discovery-grants-2011-in-computer-science/">I did for 2011</a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/NSERC-CRSNG/FundingDecisions-DecisionsFinancement/ResearchGrants-SubventionsDeRecherche/ResultsGSC-ResultatsCSS_eng.asp?Year=2012">full list of results can be found here</a>.</p>

<h3>What is the distribution of grants?</h3>


<p>First, the total amount for Discovery Grants in Computer Science was $5,943,920 per year ($5,126,543 last year) divided into 227 grants (202 last year). There were 11 1-year, 3 3-year, 213 5-year (10 1-year, 1 2-year, 1-3 year and the rest 5 years in 2011). They went to 49 different institutions (45 in 2011).</p>

<p>Minimum amount was (like the year before) $14k, first quantile $17k (20k last year), median $22k (24 last year), average $26,185 ($25.380k last year), third quartile $28k ($29k), and maximum of $122.2 ($96k last year). A Shapiro-Wilk test shows that this distribution appears NOT to be normal (p &lt;&lt; 0.01).</p>

<p>Compared to 2011, there was more money available per person (26.2k versus 25.4k), and there were many more smaller grant, but also the larger grants accounted for a larger share (one person got a lot of money).</p>

<p>This is the distribution of grants per amount.</p>

<pre>

17,000      32
19,000      9 
22,000      47
27,000      2 
27,920      1 
28,000      39

<p>A simple way to visualize this data is tot plot individuals to amounts. Colours reflect the province (click to enlarge):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2012/nserc2012byInd.png"></p>

<p>As it can be seen, there is a fairly uniform distribution across the lowest amounts, with few outliers to the right. Not surprisingly Ontario is, again, the most frequent.
Ontario and BC represent most of the points at the right side.</p>

<p>Here is a breakdown of the 4 big ones:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2012/ab2012.png"></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2012/bc2012.png"></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2012/on2012.png"></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2012/qc2012.png"></p>

<h3>How do institutions compare?</h3>


<p>I present the results arranged by University. Each vertical column is
a university; they have been sorted by province.  Each point in the
plot is a recipient. The colour of the point represents the type of
grant (1 to 5 years). Most are 5 years, with few being 1 year (what I
call probation grant: they either have faith you can do significantly
better next year, or they are giving you a warning signal).</p>

<p>The median across the country was $22k per year (in the spirit of disclosure mine is $24k&mdash;2011).</p>

<p>The boxplots are a simpler way to compare universities and are
overlayed on the data. I have removed outliers from them to avoid
confusion with the data points. Of course, if you have paid attention
to your stats courses you will know that boxplots are good when the
data is normally distributed (which I don&rsquo;t assume it is). Hence their
use in this data is flawed, but they are still useful.</p>

<p>I also got curious who the high fliers were. And below the points are labelled.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>FC Barcelona is finally champion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_La_Liga">la
Liga</a>. It is
certainly an accomplishment to have won 4 out of the last 5
championships. Yet this year has a sombre tone. The loss against
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/may/01/barcelona-bayern-munich-live-mbm-report">Bayern
0-7</a>
left much to be desired. <!--more-->It was not only that they lost, but the
apathy of the team during the second game. It was clear they had given
up.</p>

<p>Has Bar√ßa finally reached its zenith? Only time will tell. Sid Lowe, who has a PhD in history, has the one of the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2013/may/02/barcelona-bayern-munich-champions-league">best analysis of the what the future might be</a>.</p>

<p>The photo at the right was taken in Feb. 2012, at Camp Nou. Messi almost scored in this play. Look at where he left the players behind him. He is one of a kind.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am tired of web-based blogging. I want to blog when I want, where I
want&mdash;that includes not having an internet connection&mdash;-and don&rsquo;t be
forced to use any specific infrastructure to do it.</p>

<p>Why? because I like my editor. And every time I have to use a
different editing environment I feel trustrated.</p>

<p>So here it goes again&hellip; a reboot of my web site. Well, it just has to
happen every few years&hellip;</p>
