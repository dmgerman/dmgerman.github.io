    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>FC Barcelona is finally champion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_La_Liga">la
Liga</a>. It is
certainly an accomplishment to have won 4 out of the last 5
championships. Yet this year has a sombre tone. The loss against
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/may/01/barcelona-bayern-munich-live-mbm-report">Bayern
0-7</a>
left much to be desired. <!--more-->It was not only that they lost, but the
apathy of the team during the second game. It was clear they had given
up.</p>

<p>Has Barça finally reached its zenith? Only time will tell. Sid Lowe, who has a PhD in history, has the one of the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2013/may/02/barcelona-bayern-munich-champions-league">best analysis of the what the future might be</a>.</p>

<p>The photo at the right was taken in Feb. 2012, at Camp Nou. Messi almost scored in this play. Look at where he left the players behind him. He is one of a kind.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am tired of web-based blogging. I want to blog when I want, where I
want&mdash;that includes not having an internet connection&mdash;-and don&rsquo;t be
forced to use any specific infrastructure to do it.</p>

<p>Why? because I like my editor. And every time I have to use a
different editing environment I feel trustrated.</p>

<p>So here it goes again&hellip; a reboot of my web site. Well, it just has to
happen every few years&hellip;</p>

    <link href="http://turingmachine.org/bl/2011/06/21/nserc-discovery-grants-2011-in-computer-science/"/>
    <updated>2011-06-21T23:50:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://turingmachine.org/bl/2011/06/21/nserc-discovery-grants-2011-in-computer-science</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NSERC has published the results of the <a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/NSERC-CRSNG/FundingDecisions-DecisionsFinancement/ResearchGrants-SubventionsDeRecherche/ResultsGSC-ResultatsCSS_eng.asp?Year=2011">NSERC discovery grant
competition in
2011</a>. NSERC
only published the raw data, so with a little bit of initiative one
can retrieve it and visualize it.</p>

<p>I had several questions about this data&hellip;.</p>

<p> <!--more--></p>

<h3>What is the distribution of grants?</h3>


<p>First, the total amount for Discovery Grants in Computer Science was $5,126,543 per year divided in 202 grants (10 1 year, 1 2 year, 1 3 year and the rest 5 years). They went to 45 different institutions.</p>

<p>Minimum amount was $14k, first quantile $20k, median $24k, average, $25.380k, third quartile $29k, and maximum of $96k (find out below who got it). A Shapiro-Wilk test shows that this distribution appears NOT to be normal (p &lt;&lt; 0.01).</p>

<p>This is the distribution of grants per amount.</p>

<pre>
14,000 46
15,000 1
18,000 1
20,000 39
24,000 43
29,000 34
33,000 19
42,000 7
49,000 6
59,243 1
60,000 1
60,300 1
76,000 1
85,000 1
96,000 1
</pre>


<p>A simple way to visualize this data is tot plot individuals to amounts. Colours reflect the province (click to enlarge):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2011/nserc2011byInd.png"></p>

<p>As it can be seen, there is a fairly uniform distribution across the lowest amounts, with few outliers to the right. Not surprisingly Ontario is the most frequent.
Ontario and BC represent most of the points at the right side. It is surprising to see the absence of Alberta there (its highest is 33k).</p>

<p>Here is a breakdown of the 4 big ones:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2011/ab2011.png"></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2011/bc2011.png"></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2011/on2011.png"></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2011/qc2011.png"></p>

<h3>How do institutions compare?</h3>


<p>I present the results arranged by University. Each vertical column is
a university; they have been sorted by province.  Each point in the
plot is a recipient. The colour of the point represents the type of
grant (1 to 5 years). Most are 5 years, with few being 1 year (what I
call probation grant: they either have faith you can do significantly
better next year, or they are giving you a warning signal).</p>

<p>The median across the country was $24k per year (in the spirit of disclosure mine was $24k).</p>

<p>The boxplots are a simpler way to compare universities and are
overlayed on the data. I have removed outliers from them to avoid
confusion with the data points. Of course, if you have paid attention
to your stats courses you will know that boxplots are good when the
data is normally distributed (which I don&rsquo;t assume it is). Hence their
use in this data is flawed, but they are still useful.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2011/nserc2011byInst.png"></p>

<p>I also got curious who the high fliers were. And below the points are labelled.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This weekend I watched &ldquo;The People vs Larry Flint&rdquo;. One of the scenes is:</p>

<!--more-->


<p><blockquote><p>Larry: You guys read Playboy?<br/>Friend 1: Well yeah.<br/>Friend 2: Sure.<br/>Jimmy: Yeah.<br/>Larry: Uhmm &hellip; Did you, uh&mdash;excuse me, Baby. Did you enjoy this month&rsquo;s article on how to hook up your quadraphonic stereo system?<br/>Friend 3: I think I missed that one.<br/>Larry: And, uh, did you follow their advice on how to make a perfect martini?<br/>Chester: Hey, Larry, c'mon man, move over.<br/>Larry: Who is this magazine for anyway? I mean, ya know, it&rsquo;s like if you don&rsquo;t make twenty thousand-plus a year, you don&rsquo;t jerk off. Seven million people buying it, and nobody&rsquo;s reading it. Gentlemen, Playboy is mocking you!</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Today I opened the New York Times Travel Magazine, that is included
with the Sunday edition of the paper (yes, I get the paper version). I
found an editorial for the <a href="http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/geek-chic-power-ranger/">Yves Saint Laurent&rsquo;s Travel Adapter</a>, at a
list price of 450 US. The description reads: &ldquo;Considering how long
stylish travelers have had to cart around less-than-beautiful
electrical doohickeys, it&rsquo;s a wonder that fashion hasn&rsquo;t come to the
rescue sooner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wonder if the New York Times is mocking me.</p>

<p>And I haven&rsquo;t even mentioned the ads for many of its products.</p>
