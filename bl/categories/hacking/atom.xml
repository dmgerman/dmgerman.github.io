    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every few years I decide that it is time to use a new infrastructure
to start blogging. This time <a href="http://leif.me">Leif</a> suggested that I look into
<a href="http://octopress.org">Octopres</a>. I like its original tag: <em>A blogging framework for hackers</em>,
but its source infrastructure put me off (it uses ruby, of which I am no fan).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Nonetheless, after doing some research, I decided to try it and it works well.</p>

<p>It makes my website independent of the website where it runs.  It moves
the management from the deployment site to the author&rsquo;s site. And no more
need of a database. It simply creates a bunch of flat files.</p>

<p>What makes it even more interesting is that it uses flat, plain text
files. I think that is the ultimate definition of hacking tools. Flat
files are malleable, they are universal, they are easy to author, and
easy to search, and they will surve the (software) Apocalypse.</p>

<p>So the next step was to see if I could get away from having to learn a
new type of typesetting called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a>, and instead use <a href="http://org-mode">org-mode</a>. In
my opinion <strong>org-mode</strong> is the <strong>most useful tool</strong> that has landed in my
computer in the last 3 years. It has totally revolutionized the way
that I author text (including the way that I write papers).</p>

<p>Well, as it happens, I was not the only one. There has been many
people who have done the same (the church of emacs). At the end I
used Yoshinari Nomura&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/yoshinari-nomura/org-octopress">org-octopress</a>, and customized it to export to
Markdown rather than HTML (let octopress do the typesetting). This
requires Org-mode from git (org-octopress uses many new features that
have not been released yet).</p>

<h1>Some examples:</h1>

<h2>A table</h2>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<caption>This is the caption</caption>

<colgroup>
<col  class="left" />

<col  class="left" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col" class="left">This is a table</th>
<th scope="col" class="left">2nd column</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="left">Value1</td>
<td class="left">Value2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>The table above was authored like this:</p>

<pre><code>#+CAPTION: This is the caption
| This is a table | 2nd column |
|-----------------+------------|
| Value1          | Value2     |
</code></pre>

<h2>How about code?</h2>

<pre><code>(defun org-octo-md--get-option (info property-name &amp;optional default)
  (let ((property (plist-get info property-name)))
    (format "%s" (or property default ""))))
</code></pre>

<p>this is what I wrote:</p>

<pre><code>#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun org-octo-md--get-option (info property-name &amp;optional default)
  (let ((property (plist-get info property-name)))
    (format "%s" (or property default ""))))
#+END_SRC
</code></pre>

<h2>But here is where it excels: code execution inside text files</h2>

<p>In org-mode you can have snippets of code that generate text that is
then used in the document. It can also generate images that are then embedded in the document.
Here is an
example of a dotty generated image:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2013/exampleDotty.png" alt="Example of Dotty Image" /></p>

<p>This is what I wrote:</p>

<pre><code>:NOT:
#+NAME: dottyExample
#+BEGIN_SRC dot :file /assets/images/2013/exampleDotty.png :exports results
digraph G {
   rankdir=RL;
   node [shape=circle width="0.7cm" height="0.7cm" fontsize=16 penwidth=2];
   edge [color=red penwidth=3]

   "dots1" [label="..." color=white fontsize=30]
   "r" [shape=circle  fillcolor=white style=filled label="r"];
   "h" [shape=circle  fillcolor=white style=filled label="h"];
   "c" [shape=circle  fillcolor=green style=filled];
   "dots2" [label="..." color=white fontsize=30]

   "c" -&gt; "r" [label="            "]
   "r" -&gt; "dots1" [label="            "]
   "dots2" -&gt; "r" [label="            "]
   "h" -&gt; "dots2" [label="            "]
}}
#+END_SRC

:END:


#+RESULTS[6d2ac873c0fc0e0232e317a2a88e734600e5ac0d]: dottyExample
#+CAPTION: Example of Dotty Image
[[file:/assets/images/2013/exampleDotty.png]]

<p>I am a happy camper.</p>
