    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>FC Barcelona is finally champion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_La_Liga">la
Liga</a>. It is
certainly an accomplishment to have won 4 out of the last 5
championships. Yet this year has a sombre tone. The lost against
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/may/01/barcelona-bayern-munich-live-mbm-report">Bayern
0-7</a>
left much to be desired. It was not only that they lost, but the
apathy of the team during the second game. It was clear they had given
up.</p>

<p>Has Bar√ßa finally reached its zenith? Only time will tell. Sid Lowe, who has a PhD in history, has the one of the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2013/may/02/barcelona-bayern-munich-champions-league">best analysis of the what the future might be</a>.</p>

<p>The photo at the right was taken in Feb. 2012, at Camp Nou. Messi almost scored in this play. Look at where he left the players behind him. He is one of a kind.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am tired of web-based blogging. I want to blog when I want, where I
want&mdash;that includes not having an internet connection&mdash;-and don&rsquo;t be
forced to use any specific infrastructure to do it.</p>

<p>Why? because I like my editor. And every time I have to use a
different editing environment I feel trustrated.</p>

<p>So here it goes again&hellip; a reboot of my web site. Well, it just has to
happen every few years&hellip;</p>
