		<p>FC Barcelona is finally champion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_La_Liga">la
Liga</a>. It is
certainly an accomplishment to have won 4 out of the last 5
championships. Yet this year has a sombre tone. The lost against
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/may/01/barcelona-bayern-munich-live-mbm-report">Bayern
0-7</a>
left much to be desired. It was not only that they lost, but the
apathy of the team during the second game. It was clear they had given
up.</p>

<p>Has Bar√ßa finally reached its zenith? Only time will tell. Sid Lowe, who has a PhD in history, has the one of the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2013/may/02/barcelona-bayern-munich-champions-league">best analysis of the what the future might be</a>.</p>

<p>The photo at the right was taken in Feb. 2012, at Camp Nou. Messi almost scored in this play. Look at where he left the players behind him. He is one of a kind.</p>

			Towards a Census of Free and Open Source Licenses.</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>During the last three years I have been attending the <a href="http://fsfe.org/activities/ftf/network.en.html">European Legal
Network</a> Free Software
Legal and Licensing Workshop.  Because of
the quality of people in attendance this is probably the best
workshop/conference for open source licensing in the world.</p>

<p>This year I presented a talk called <em>Toward a census of free and open
source software licenses</em>. Ever since I started working with open
source licenses I have been looking into the issues of what licenses
are more widely used.</p>

<p>The objective of this talk is to describe that a census is not
trivial. There are many factors that can affect the final result. For
this reason it is very important to be very aware of the methodology
behind the census. Otherwise one might be misled by the results.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.man7.org/">Michael Kerrisk</a> from <a href="https://lwn.net/">LWN</a>
was in attendance. As it is customary in this workshop, its discussion
is subject to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule">Chatham House
Rule</a>. In a nutshell,
after the meeting you can mention what was discussed, but not who
discussed it.</p>

<p>For that reason Michael requested my permission to write an article at
LWN on my talk. He did a <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/547400/">great
job</a>. It is almost a play-by-play of
the presentation, which I am making available
<a href="/assets/presentations/20130404-amsterdam-licenses-census.pdf">here</a>. Just
a word of advice: the numbers are preliminary. We&rsquo;ll publish
accurate in the very short future.</p>

		<p>I am tired of web-based blogging. I want to blog when I want, where I
want&mdash;that includes not having an internet connection&mdash;-and don&rsquo;t be
forced to use any specific infrastructure to do it.</p>

<p>Why? because I like my editor. And every time I have to use a
different editing environment I feel trustrated.</p>

<p>So here it goes again&hellip; a reboot of my web site. Well, it just has to
happen every few years&hellip;</p>
