In a presented he gave almost 3 years ago at Harvard he talked about
his approach to cooking and some of the innovative techniques he has
developed. But what remember the most are two questions he was posed
by the audience, and his answers:

\#+quote
Audience member: "Roasted Hey, wood stocks, apparently turn into very tasty things. There has to be some really abysmal failures you'd never wish on the tongues of even your worst enemies&#x2026;Any you would like to share?"
Grant: "There are tones of failures. But we know that going in. We are not afraid  to fail.
\\#+end\_quote

I suspect that that attitude: willing to try and not being afraid to fail is what makes them succeed.

Another interesting question is:

\#+quote
Audience member: "I had to add three things to my kitchen that my parents didn't have, what would they be?"
\\#+end\_quote

Grant answers:

1.  Xanthan Gum

2.  IOTA Carrogena

3.  Agar Agar

I have never used IOTA, but I now use agar-agar and xanthan gum on a regular basis.


The presentation is well worth it, and also the Q&A section at the end.
