This year, during [[http://msrcanada.org/msrvision2020/][MSR Vision 20/20]] there was an interesting discussion
about providing some type of reward for researchers who share their data with
others. We decided to implement a new track--the data track-- at the
the [[http://2013.msrconf.org/][International Working Conference in Mining Software Repositories]]
this year. I volunteered to be its chair.

We decided that the papers would be 4 pages long and should describe
datasets that are to be shared with others.  It was a total success. Of
27 papers we accepted 15. I really hope that some of these datasets
become seminal to the community.
