    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The results of the NSERC Discovery Grants for 2013 have been published.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/NSERC-CRSNG/FundingDecisions-DecisionsFinancement/ResearchGrants-SubventionsDeRecherche/ResultsGSC-ResultatsCSS_eng.asp?Year=2013">full list of results can be found here</a>.

<!-- more -->


<h1>What is the distribution of grants?</h1>

<p>The total amount for Discovery Grants in Computer Science was
$4,894,000 (
$5,943,920 last year) divided into 204 grants
(227 last year). There were 3 1-year and 187 5-year
(11 1-year, 3 3-year, 213 5-year in 2012). They went to 42 different institutions (49 last year).</p>

<p>Minimum amount was $15k ($14k last year), first quartile $20k ($17k),
median $20 ($22k), mean $25.758k ($25.38k), 3rd $30k ($28k), max $75k
($122.2k).</p>

<p>Compared to 2012, there is a slight reduction in the size awards.</p>

<p>This is the distribution of grants per amount.</p>

<p>A simple way to visualize this data is tot plot individuals to amounts. Colours reflect the province (click to enlarge):</p>

<p><img src="http://turingmachine.org/assets/images/2013/nserc2013byInd.png"></p>

<p>As it can be seen, there is a fairly uniform distribution across the lowest amounts, with few outliers to the right. Not surprisingly Ontario is, again, the most frequent.
Ontario and BC represent most of the points at the right side.</p>

<h2>By Province</h2>

<p>Here is a breakdown of the 4 big ones:</p>

<p><img src="http://turingmachine.org/assets/images/2013/ab2013.png" alt="Alberta" /></p>

<p><img src="http://turingmachine.org/assets/images/2013/bc2013.png" alt="British Columbia" /></p>

<p><img src="http://turingmachine.org/assets/images/2013/on2013.png" alt="Ontario" /></p>

<p><img src="http://turingmachine.org/assets/images/2013/qc2013.png" alt="Quebec" /></p>

<h2>How do institutions compare?</h2>

<p>I present the results arranged by University. Each vertical column is
a university; they have been sorted by province.  Each point in the
plot is a recipient. The colour of the point represents the type of
grant (1 to 5 years). Most are 5 years, with few being 1 year (what I
call probation grant: they either have faith you can do significantly
better next year, or they are giving you a warning signal).</p>

<p>The median across the country was $20k per year (in the spirit of disclosure mine is $24k&#x2013;2011).</p>

<p>The boxplots are a simpler way to compare universities and are
overlayed on the data. I have removed outliers from them to avoid
confusion with the data points. Of course, if you have paid attention
to your stats courses you will know that boxplots are good when the
data is normally distributed (which I don&rsquo;t assume it is). Hence their
use in this data is flawed, but they are still useful.</p>

<p><img src="http://turingmachine.org/assets/images/2013/nserc2013byInst.png" alt="By institution" /></p>

<p>I also got curious who the high fliers were. And below the points are labelled.</p>

<p><img src="http://turingmachine.org/assets/images/2013/nserc2013byInstLabels.png" alt="By institution with labels." /></p>

<h2>Everybody</h2>

<p>And here is the list of every single person:</p>

<p><img src="http://turingmachine.org/assets/images/2013/nserc2013all.png" alt="Everybody." /></p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>At this point, everybody is in the new cycle. This will make comparing across years easier. That will be the next installment&#x2026;</p>

    <link href="http://turingmachine.org/bl/2013-05-24-what-does-an-imdb-rating-of-a-movie-mean.html"/>
    <updated>2013-05-24T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://turingmachine.org/bl/what-does-an-imdb-rating-of-a-movie-mean</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The last few years I have found less and less interesting movies to
watch. Maybe I am just getting old ;)</p>

<p>One simple, but effective way I have used in the past to determine if
a movie is worth watching is to use its <a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a> rating. Except for few comedies (e.g. Monty Python) I have always enjoyed any movie in the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/chart/top">IMDB TOP 250</a>.</p>

<p>But what is a good ranking? Let us try to answer that question&#x2026;</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I have data from the IMDB up to May 2013. One of the files that they
provide includes, for each movie, a weighted rank (from 0 to 10), and the
number of votes (plus some other info that we are not going to use).</p>

<p>There are 210,371 movies. But not all of them have the same
importance. The minimum number of votes is 5 and the maximum 971,041
&mdash;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161">The Shawshank Redemption (1994)</a>, one of the IMDBs all-time favorites.</p>

<p>Here is the distribution of the number of votes in that dataset. 75%
of movies have less than 118 votes!</p>

<pre><code>    Votes       
Min.   :     5  
1st Qu.:    11  
Median :    26  
Mean   :  1524  
3rd Qu.:   118  
Max.   :971041  
</code></pre>

<p>Let us choose only movies that have a significant number of votes. Let
us use 10k as the threshold. This leave us with 4,634 movies (I wonder
how many movies Pic A Flic has).  This is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot">Violin plot</a> of the rank of
movies in the IMD with at least 10,000 votes. It shows, in a single
plot, two ones: a density kernel (the outside) and boxplot (the
inside). The kernel tell us that this has an almost normal
distribution and its peak is around 6.7. In fact, the median is 6.7
(that means that 50 percent of movies with at least 10k votes are
above 6.7) and the average is 6.6. In fact, the 75% is 7.4 (the black
area in the middle of the plot ends at the first 25%, and 75%
quartiles&#x2013;i.e. 25% of the movies are below 6.0). So if you go to the
Rental store, and see a movie that is relatively popular and has a
rank of 7.5, then it is within the top 25% of movies. If you are very picky,
use a threshold of 8.0: there are only 430 with higher than 8, or approximately 9% of the
movies in the IMDB with at least 10k votes.</p>

<p><img src="http://turingmachine.org/assets/images/2013/imdbByVotes.png" alt="Violin plot of the distribution of Rank of Movies with at least 10k votes." /></p>

<p>This only holds true for Movies. For TV-shows the numbers are very
skewed towards 10, and there have significantly less votes.</p>

<p>So next time they ask you: <em>what movie should we rent?</em> Simply answer:
any with at least 10,000 votes in the IMDB and at least a rank
of 8. Or even better, one of the top 250.</p>

<p>One word of caution: latest movies tend to be overvalued and their
rankings lower as time passed by. For example, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2592910/">CM101MMXI Fundamentals
(2013)</a> has a current rating of 9.2 with 690,768 votes!!!! A movie I
never heard of, but maybe a total success in Turkey, has more votes
than <em>all</em> but 8 other movies, and a rank that is the highest except
for one movie. Suspicious, if you ask me. Also, the voting data the
IMDB provides does not seem to match exactly what is online.</p>

    <updated>2013-05-23T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://turingmachine.org/bl/templetizing-open-source-licenses-for-spdx</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the problems of automatic license matching is that some open
source licenses are expected to be modified every time they are
used. For example, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#3-clause_license_.28.22Revised_BSD_License.22.2C_.22New_BSD_License.22.2C_or_.22Modified_BSD_License.22.29">BSD3</a> license is expected to have several
sections replaced by the one that uses it, such as its copyright
holder and year of copyright:</p>

<pre><code>Copyright (c) &lt;year&gt;, &lt;copyright holder&gt;
All rights reserved.

Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
...
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that information is not standardized. The <a href="http://spdx.org/SPDX">SPDX</a> is tryig
to do this. As part of the team, and given my experience, I have been
helping. My proposal is the following:</p>

<h1>A proposal for templetization of Free and Open Source licenses for SPDX</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Certain sections of a license vary as they are used. Some of this
variability is by design (think of the BSD family of licenses). In
other cases it is due to small changes in licenses as they are copied
and propagated.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>A variable section of a license is specified with a rule. A rule is
wrapped between  and is composed of 5 parts. Each is separated
with ; (semicolo). They cannot be embedded within other rules.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>original</strong>: the original text of the rule. It should be the first field. It is required.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>match</strong>: a POSIX regular expression (semicolons are escaped with \; within it). This field is required.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>name</strong>: name of the field in the template. Each rule must have a name. This field is required.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>type</strong>: required or optional. This field is required.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>example</strong>: another example of the use of the text. This field is optional.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Example:</h2>

<pre><code>{{original=THE AUTHOR OR CONTRIBUTORS;match=.+;name=copyrightHolderLiability;type=required;example=dmg inc.}}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is an example of the its use for the BSD3:</p>

<pre><code>{{original=(c) &lt;year&gt; &lt;copyright holder&gt;;match=Copyright \(c\).+ All rights reserved.;name=copyrigh;type=optional;example=Copyright (c) 1994 David Burren All rights reserved}}

organization and developer collaboration is not well understood.
In this paper, we use a theoretical argument to evaluate the
appropriateness of using DVC in the context of two very common
organization forms in OSS: a dictatorship and a peer group. We
find that DVC facilitates large hierarchical communities as well as
smaller groups of developers, while CVC allows for consensus-
building by a peer group. We also find that the flexibility of
DVC systems allows for diverse styles of developer collaboration.
With CVC, changes flow up and down (and publicly) via a
central repository. In contrast, DVC facilitates collaboration in
which work output can flow sideways (and privately) between
collaborators, with no repository being inherently more impor-
tant or central. These sideways flows are a relatively new concept.
Developers on the Linux project, who tend to be experienced DVC
users, cluster around “sandboxes:” repositories where developers
can work together on a particular topic, isolating their changes
from other developers. In this work, we focus on two large,
mature OSS projects to illustrate these findings. However, we
suggest that social media sites like GitHub may engender other
original styles of collaboration that deserve further study.</p></blockquote>

<p>This paper is a description of the new method to deploy releases in
GNOME in a manner that uses a version control model. The goal is to
make it easy to deploy (and equally important) rollback releases of
the entire desktop.</p>

<p>This is its Bibtex entry:</p>

<p>and this its abstract:</p>

<blockquote><p>In Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) projects
based on Linux systems, the users usually install the software
from distributions. The distributions act as intermediaries be-
tween software developers and users. Distributors collect the
source code of the different projects and package them, ready
to be installed by the users. Packages seems to work well for
managing and distributing stable major and minor releases. It
presents, however, various release management challenges for
developers of projects with multiples dependencies not always
available in the stable version of their systems. In projects like
GNOME, composed of dozens of individual components, devel-
opers must build newer versions of the libraries and applications
that their applications depend upon before working in their own
projects. This process can be cumbersome for developers who are
not programmers, such as user interaction designers or technical
writers. In this paper we describe some of the problems that the
current distribution model presents to do continuous integration,
testing and deployment for developers in GNOME, and present
ongoing work intended to address these problems that uses a git-
like approach to the building and deployment of applications.</p></blockquote>

    <updated>2013-05-21T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://turingmachine.org/bl/tactics-</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Wilson_(writer)">Jonathan Wilson</a> is one of the best analysts of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football">Beautiful Game</a>. He
answers an important question: <em>what is the relationship between
players and tactics?</em> and then I ask <em>does this have any relevance to
software engineering?</em></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>His <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2013/apr/10/th-question-players-tactics-jonathan-wilson">article</a> breaks tactics into two layers: <em>base</em> and
<em>superstructure</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Base governs which side creates more chances and what sort of chances
they are; superstructure determines whether those chances are taken.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, it is more complex than that. I wonder if there is an extra
layer: the skill of each player. Perhaps this is part of the
<em>base</em>. Skill is divided into the innate, and the part that can be
taught&#x2013;usually in the long term. It is not the same to have Messi,
Falcao or Ronaldo in your team compared to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Wondolowski">Chris Wondolowski</a>. Rich
teams can improve this part of their <em>base</em> with signings, hence the
reason we are seeing the establishment of the era of the Super Teams
in EUFA.</p>

<p>There is another part of the <em>base</em> that is essentially the work
that a coach does for a team. This includes the organization of the
team on the field, the design of set pieces, the preparation before
each game, the designation of the starting 11, substitutions, etc.</p>

<p>And this helps explain why I admire some coaches, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Pellegrini">Pellegrini</a>,
who with a weaker <em>base</em> of players, can create a team that can
compete with the best in Europe. I think he will be spectacular in his
new job at Manchester City.</p>

<p>Then it comes superstructure, which is the non-deterministic part of
the game, and why we are not playing with robots.</p>

<p>In Wilson&rsquo;s words, the objective of the tactics is to reduce the
chances to score of the other team, and to improve your own.  His
analysis makes me think of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210166/">Moneyball</a>.  One of Billy Beane&rsquo;s goals was to get
players that improved the chance to score runs for a team.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Software development is a team sport.'>
Which brings me to software engineering: <strong>Software development is a team sport.</strong>
Any software development team has players with their own /base/. Some
are better than others. We can always go out and try to hire /better
ones/ (based on pure skill). We know that some programmers can be as
productive as 10 times others.
html:</span></p>

<p>There is a part of their <em>base</em> that can be taught. I always wonder
why managers are not more proactive at teaching their players how to
improve their debugging or editing. It is as if these skills are
expected to be learned on their own. As if we are knowledge workers,
not production line ones, even though frequently we would benefit from
learning how to improve our processes as if we were in a production line.</p>

<p>Now, imagine you were just promoted to be the coach (the <em>manager</em>) of
the team. You might have a chance to make few signings or you might
have to be content with the team you have (unless you work for a Super
Team &#x2014;e.g. Google&#x2014; where you might have a lot of money to hire the
best) . Say you get a budget, what type of player would you hire?</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='If tactics play a role in software development, then
we need to choose a player that fits the team, and makes the team
better; not necessarily the best player available in the market.'>
Think about it. If tactics play a role in software development, then
we need to choose a player that fits the team, and makes the team
better; not necessarily the best player available in the market. And
who works better for the team might not be the best developer out
there. For example, a team might be better of with a great tester than
with a productive software developer that hates testing. Are these
decisions considered by a typical manager? I don&rsquo;t know.
html:</span></p>

<p>Now, if we take a Moneyball point of view, we should start to align
features of players with their ability to create chances to score. In
software development teams this means the chance not to screw
up. Software development teams are combination of individuals each
with unique strengths; if the manager is able to create a good <em>base</em>
around them, they will be able to produce more than working
individually (even if working towards the same common goal).</p>

<p>I have had a SE manager that was a good tactician (I had around 10 in
my life as a developer). I wonder if they exist. Usually they care
about tracking deadlines, and break the work apart so each of us could
do our part, but I never had a feeling that we were working together
supporting each other as we completed our work.</p>

<p>I am sure there are certainly software developers that make their
teams better around them. I think we need to learn to quantify
this. And we need to learn how to make software development managers
better at improving their <em>base</em>.</p>

<p>In a presentation he gave at Harvard (almost 3 years ago) he talked about
his approach to cooking and some of the innovative techniques he has
developed. But what I remember the most are two questions he was posed
by the audience, and his answers:</p>

<blockquote><p>Audience member: &ldquo;Roasted hey, wood stocks, apparently turn into very tasty things. There has to be some really abysmal failures you&rsquo;d never wish on the tongues of even your worst enemies&#x2026;Any you would like to share?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grant: &ldquo;There are tonnes of failures. But we know that going in. <strong>We are not afraid  to fail</strong>.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>I suspect that that attitude: willing to try and not being afraid to fail is what makes them succeed.</p>

<p>Another interesting question is:</p>

<blockquote><p>Audience member: &ldquo;If I had to add three things to my kitchen that my parents didn&rsquo;t have, what would they be?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Grant answers:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthan_gum">Xanthan Gum</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrageenan">IOTA Carrogeenan</a></p></li>

<p>I have never used IOTA, but I use agar-agar and xanthan gum on a regular basis.</p>

<p>The presentation is well worth it, and also the Q&amp;A section at the end.</p>

<p>The main objective of the paper is to try to determine what are the
characteristics that make a patch being accepted by the Linux
development team.</p>

<p>This is its Bibtex entry:</p>

<pre><code>@inproceedings{dmg2013-relenggit,
  title="{Will My Patch Make It? And How Fast? Case Study on the Linux Kernel}",
  author={Yujuan Jiang and Bram Adams and Daniel M. German},
  booktitle={International Working Conference of Mining Software Repositories, MSR'2013},
  year={2013},
  month= "May",
  pages = "101--110",
}
</code></pre>

<p>and this its abstract:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Linux kernel follows an extremely distributed reviewing and
integration process supported by 130 developer mailing lists and a
hierarchy of dozens of Git repositories for version control. Since not
every patch can make it and of those that do, some patches require a
lot more reviewing and integration effort than others, developers,
reviewers and integrators need support for estimating which patches
are worthwhile to spend effort on and which ones do not stand a
chance. This paper cross-links and analyzes eight years of patch
reviews from the kernel mailing lists and committed patches from the
Git repository to understand which patches are accepted and how long
it takes those patches to get to the end user. We found that 33\% of
the patches makes it into a Linux release, and that most of them need
3 to 6 months for this. Furthermore, that patches developed by more
experienced developers are more easily accepted and faster reviewed
and integrated. Additionally, reviewing time is impacted by submission
time, the number of affected subsystems by the patch and the number of
requested reviewers.</p></blockquote>

<p>The main outcome is that experience plays one of the most important
factors.</p>

    <updated>2013-05-14T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://turingmachine.org/bl/using-octopress-and-org-mode</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every few years I decide that it is time to use a new infrastructure
to start blogging. This time <a href="http://leif.me">Leif</a> suggested that I look into
<a href="http://octopress.org">Octopres</a>. I like its original tag: <em>A blogging framework for hackers</em>,
but its source infrastructure put me off (it uses ruby, of which I am no fan).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Nonetheless, after doing some research, I decided to try it and it works well.</p>

<p>It makes my website independent of the website where it runs.  It moves
the management from the deployment site to the author&rsquo;s site. And no more
need of a database. It simply creates a bunch of flat files.</p>

<p>What makes it even more interesting is that it uses flat, plain text
files. I think that is the ultimate definition of hacking tools. Flat
files are malleable, they are universal, they are easy to author, and
easy to search, and they will surve the (software) Apocalypse.</p>

<p>So the next step was to see if I could get away from having to learn a
new type of typesetting called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a>, and instead use <a href="http://org-mode">org-mode</a>. In
my opinion <strong>org-mode</strong> is the <strong>most useful tool</strong> that has landed in my
computer in the last 3 years. It has totally revolutionized the way
that I author text (including the way that I write papers).</p>

<p>Well, as it happens, I was not the only one. There has been many
people who have done the same (the church of emacs). At the end I
used Yoshinari Nomura&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/yoshinari-nomura/org-octopress">org-octopress</a>, and customized it to export to
Markdown rather than HTML (let octopress do the typesetting). This
requires Org-mode from git (org-octopress uses many new features that
have not been released yet).</p>

<h1>Some examples:</h1>

<h2>A table</h2>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<caption>This is the caption</caption>

<colgroup>
<col  class="left" />

<col  class="left" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col" class="left">This is a table</th>
<th scope="col" class="left">2nd column</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="left">Value1</td>
<td class="left">Value2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>The table above was authored like this:</p>

<pre><code>#+CAPTION: This is the caption
| This is a table | 2nd column |
|-----------------+------------|
| Value1          | Value2     |
</code></pre>

<h2>How about code?</h2>

<pre><code>(defun org-octo-md--get-option (info property-name &amp;optional default)
  (let ((property (plist-get info property-name)))
    (format "%s" (or property default ""))))
</code></pre>

<p>this is what I wrote:</p>

<pre><code>#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun org-octo-md--get-option (info property-name &amp;optional default)
  (let ((property (plist-get info property-name)))
    (format "%s" (or property default ""))))
#+END_SRC
</code></pre>

<h2>But here is where it excels: code execution inside text files</h2>

<p>In org-mode you can have snippets of code that generate text that is
then used in the document. It can also generate images that are then embedded in the document.
Here is an
example of a dotty generated image:</p>

<p><img src="http://turingmachine.org/assets/images/2013/exampleDotty.png" alt="Example of Dotty Image" /></p>

<h1>What is the distribution of grants?</h1>

<p>First, the total amount for Discovery Grants in Computer Science was
$5,943,920 per year ($5,126,543 last year) divided into 227 grants
(202 last year). There were 11 1-year, 3 3-year, 213 5-year (10
1-year, 1 2-year, 1-3 year and the rest 5 years in 2011). They went to
49 different institutions (45 in 2011).</p>

<p>Minimum amount was (like the year before) $14k, first quantile $17k
(20k last year), median $22k (24 last year), average $26,185 ($25.380k
last year), third quartile $28k ($29k), and maximum of $122.2 ($96k
last year). A Shapiro-Wilk test shows that this distribution appears
NOT to be normal (p &lt;&lt; 0.01).</p>

<p>Compared to 2011, there was more money available per person (26.2k
versus 25.4k), and there were many more smaller grant, but also the
larger grants accounted for a larger share (one person got a lot of
money).</p>

<p>This is the distribution of grants per amount.</p>

<p>A simple way to visualize this data is tot plot individuals to amounts. Colours reflect the province (click to enlarge):</p>

<p><img src="http://turingmachine.org/assets/images/2012/nserc2012byInd.png"></p>

<p>As it can be seen, there is a fairly uniform distribution across the lowest amounts, with few outliers to the right. Not surprisingly Ontario is, again, the most frequent.
Ontario and BC represent most of the points at the right side.</p>

<p>Here is a breakdown of the 4 big ones:</p>

<h2>How do institutions compare?</h2>

<p>I present the results arranged by University. Each vertical column is
a university; they have been sorted by province.  Each point in the
plot is a recipient. The colour of the point represents the type of
grant (1 to 5 years). Most are 5 years, with few being 1 year (what I
call probation grant: they either have faith you can do significantly
better next year, or they are giving you a warning signal).</p>

<p>The median across the country was $22k per year (in the spirit of disclosure mine is $24k&#x2013;2011).</p>

<p>The boxplots are a simpler way to compare universities and are
overlayed on the data. I have removed outliers from them to avoid
confusion with the data points. Of course, if you have paid attention
to your stats courses you will know that boxplots are good when the
data is normally distributed (which I don&rsquo;t assume it is). Hence their
use in this data is flawed, but they are still useful.</p>

<p><img src="http://turingmachine.org/assets/images/2012/nserc2012byInst.png" alt="By institution" /></p>

<p>I also got curious who the high fliers were. And below the points are labelled.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I knew I was never going to be able to get a reservation at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Bulli">elBulli</a> (note the camelCase
:).  But since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferran_Adri%C3%A0">Ferran
Adrià</a> decided to close it
I knew I had a chance to one day eat at the best restaurant in the
world.</p>

<p>Looking at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World's_50_Best_Restaurants">rakings of the best places to
eat</a> <!-- more -->
I decided that that restaurant was going to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Celler_de_Can_Roca">El Cellar de CanRoca</a>.</p>

<p>Two years before, I was visiting Girona, and decided to walk into the
restaurant (no planning from my part, as usual). Of course, there was
no space :). I asked my friend Jaume, who lives in Girona, to reserve
a table. He did, last year.  And just few days ago, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2013/apr/29/el-celler-de-can-roca-restaurant">the Cellar was
named the best restaurant in the
world</a>. I
am glad we went when we did. I was told that the day it was announced,
its web site crashed and they got thousands of phone calls.</p>

<p>Was it worth it? You bet. Here are the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/28858028@N00/sets/72157629963362602/">photos of each of the dishes
we were
served</a>. It
has been, without a doubt, the best meal in my life, and the longest
(we arrived at 1:30 and left at 5:30).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>FC Barcelona is finally champion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_La_Liga">La Liga</a>. It is certainly an
accomplishment to have won 4 out of the last 5 championships. Yet this
year has a sombre tone. The loss against <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/may/01/barcelona-bayern-munich-live-mbm-report">Bayern 0-7</a> left much to be
desired.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It was not only that they lost, but the
apathy of the team during the second game. It was clear they had given
up.</p>

<p>Has Barça finally reached its zenith? Only time will tell. Sid Lowe, who has a PhD in history, has the one of the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2013/may/02/barcelona-bayern-munich-champions-league">best analysis of the what the future might be</a>.</p>

<p>The photo at the right was taken in Feb. 2012, at Camp Nou. Messi almost scored in this play. Look at where he left the players behind him. He is one of a kind.</p>

    <id>http://turingmachine.org/bl/towards-a-census-of-used-open-source-licenses</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During the last three years I have been attending the <a href="http://fsfe.org/activities/ftf/network.en.html">European Legal
Network</a> Free Software Legal and Licensing Workshop. Because of the
quality of people in attendance this is probably the best
workshop/conference for open source licensing in the world.</p>

<p>This year I presented a talk called <strong>Toward a census of free and open
source software licenses</strong>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Ever since I started working with open
source licenses I have been looking into the issues of what licenses
are more widely used.</p>

<p>The objective of this talk is to describe that a census is not
trivial. There are many factors that can affect the final result. For
this reason it is very important to be very aware of the methodology
behind the census. Otherwise one might be misled by the results.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.man7.org/">Michael Kerrisk</a> from <a href="https://lwn.net/">LWN</a> was in attendance. As it is customary in this
workshop, its discussion is subject to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule">Chatham House Rule</a>. In a
nutshell, after the meeting you can mention what was discussed, but
not who discussed it.</p>

<p>For that reason Michael requested my permission to write an article at
LWN on my talk. He did a <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/547400/">great job</a>. It is almost a play-by-play of the
presentation:</p>

<p>Only a word of advice: the numbers are preliminary. We&rsquo;ll publish
accurate in the very short future.</p>

NSERC only published the raw data, so with a
little bit of initiative one can retrieve it and visualize it.</p>

<p>I had several questions about this data&#x2026;.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>What is the distribution of grants?</h1>

<p>First, the total amount for Discovery Grants in Computer Science was $5,126,543 per year divided in 202 grants (10 1 year, 1 2 year, 1 3 year and the rest 5 years). They went to 45 different institutions.</p>

<p>Minimum amount was $14k, first quantile $20k, median $24k, average, $25.380k, third quartile $29k, and maximum of $96k (find out below who got it). A Shapiro-Wilk test shows that this distribution appears NOT to be normal (p &lt;&lt; 0.01).</p>

<p>This is the distribution of grants per amount.</p>

Ontario and BC represent most of the points at the right side. It is surprising to see the absence of Alberta there (its highest is 33k).</p>

<p>Here is a breakdown of the 4 big ones:</p>
