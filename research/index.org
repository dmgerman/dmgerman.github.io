** The Team
<a id="sec-2"></a>

I don't work alone. My accomplishments are really the accomplishments
of my team. I have worked with a number of researchers around the
world, but one group of people who are particularly important are my graduate
students --and postdoc. They are:

- [[http://thesegalgroup.org/people/eirini-kalliamvakou/][Eirini  Kalliamvakou]]. PhD Student, co-supervised with [[http://danadamian.wordpress.com/][Daniela Damian]].
- [[http://calcifer.org/][Germán Poo-Caamaño]]. PhD Student.
- [[http://www.seanstevenson.com/][Seán Stevenson]]. MSc Student, co-supervised with [[http://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/~mstorey][Peggy Storey]].
- [[http://leif.me][Leif Singer]]. Postdoc, co-supervised with  [[http://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/~mstorey][Peggy Storey]].

** Research

<a id="sec-4"></a> 
My main area of research is software engineering but once in a while I
do work in computational photography. These are three main sub-areas where
I have been doing research lately:

*** Intellectual property and software engineering

<a id="sec-4-1"></a>
#+begin_quote
The long term goal is to incorporate software
licensing concerns of reusing licensed components into the software
development processes.
#+end_quote

Most large software applications are built by combining several
components, such as reused code snippets, libraries, or other
applications.  There is a large body of research dedicated to the
technical aspects of supporting and improving component-based software
development processes.  However, little attention has been directed
towards the technical concerns arising from the reuse of components
with different licenses.

Our recent work (detailed below) has demonstrated that reusing
components creates new concerns for software developers that have yet
to be addressed. On one hand, a license of a component might impose
restrictions on how it can be used (e.g. unless adequately
interconnected to the rest of the system, using a component licensed
under the GNU General Public License might severely restrict the
ability to commercialize a product built upon it; on
the other hand, using a component might create risks to the
organization that need to be assessed (e.g. such as when the developer
downloads a component from the Internet and incorporates into a
product without the approval of its organization). These issues are
directly affecting the design and development of software, and are a
growing concern to software developers and their organizations.

*** Empirical Studies in Software Engineering

<a id="sec-4-2"></a>
#+begin_quote
The long term goal is to understand how
software development is performed, particularly in the context of free
and open source software.
#+end_quote


My research group and I have developed a set of methods and tools to
mine historical software repositories. Here are some examples:

- We have proposed methods to extract historical information (version
  control, defect tracking systems, ChangeLogs, mailings lists) in
  order to understand how software evolves and to reverse engineer the
  methodologies used in their development.
- We have performed numerous empirical studies to analyze how teams of
  globally distributed developers collaborate in the creation of software.
- We have developed metrics and visualizations for historical software
  development information.

*** Impact of Distributed Version Control in software development.

<a id="sec-4-3"></a>
#+begin_quote
The long term goal is to understand how distributed version control
affects the software develpment process of a team.
#+end_quote

Distributed version control systems are slowly replacing centralized
ones. We need to understand how these is happening. In our recent
research we have:

- Developed methods and techniques to mine distribued version control data.
- Described the main challenges of sturying software development that
  uses distributed version control.


*** Computational Photography

<a id="sec-4-4"></a>
#+begin_quote
The long term goal is to create new methods and tool to assist the modern photographer.
#+end_quote

This is what I call my /hobby research/. I am interested in processes,
tools and methods that improve photography. And these days this
implies using the computer. I have done work primarily in the area of *Panorama Making*.

** Service to the Community
<a id="sec-6"></a>

*** Editorial work
<a id="sec-6-1"></a>

- I am on the editorial board of the [[http://www.ifosslr.org/ifosslr][International Free and Open Source Software Law Review]]

*** Recently I have been involved in the organization of:
<a id="sec-6-2"></a>

- Chair of the Data Track of the [[http://2013.msrconf.org/][International Working Conference in Mining Software Repositories 2013]], San Francisco, 2013.
- Co-organizer of [[http://msrcanada.org/msrvision2020/][MSR Vision 2020]], the 2013 Canadian Summer School in Mining Software Repositories, Kingston, 2013.
- Co-organizer of [[http://pased.soccerlab.polymtl.ca/][PASED - Canadian Summer School on Practical Analyses of Software Engineering Data]], Montreal, 2012.
- Co-organizer of [[http://msrcanada.org/2010/04/07/back-to-school/][the 2012 Canadian Mining Summer School 2010]], Kinston, 2011.
