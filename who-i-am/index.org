I am Daniel M German, professor in the department of computer science at the University of Victoria. My duties are divided along two main areas:

- [[../research/][Research]]. My main area of research is software engineering. In
  particular, software evolution, open source and intellectual
  property.  In my spare time I do research in computational
  photography. A list of my papers can be found [[http://turingmachine.org/~dmg/papers][here]].
- Teaching. I teach several courses at Uvic, primarily Database
  Systems (CSC370), Social and Professional Issues (SENG401), Media
  Applications (SENG410) and more recently Intro to Software
  Engineering (SENG265).


** My hobbies

- [[http://silvernegative.com][My photography]].
